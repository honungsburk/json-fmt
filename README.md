# JSON Format

An educational JSON formatter that displays the use of a CST (Concrete Syntax Tree)
combined with a layout engine to produce nice formatting. The design is heavily
inspired by these articles:

- https://mcyoung.xyz/2025/03/11/formatters/
- https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/contributing/syntax.html
- https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-would-someone-use-rowan/78480
